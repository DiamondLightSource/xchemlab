# XChemLab SoakDB Interface

An interface service, providing a mechanism to save & load data from the SoakDB format. This service is intended to be used during the transition period.

## Test Data

A helper script, `collect_test_data.sh`, is included. This can be used to collect copies of all recent SoakDB databases into the `test_data` directory.
